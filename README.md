# King Installer

Install packages "as Google Play Store", to work around restrictions!   
Useful for Android Auto.

## Usage

Everything is simple - choose any apk on your smartphone, which you want to install, and click "Install As King"!
If the selected application has already been installed previously, uninstall it beforehand.
